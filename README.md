# Spatio-Temporal Football Match Outcome Prediction

This project focuses on the prediction of football match outcomes using spatio-temporal data. The main tasks involved in this project are as follows:

## Task 1: Predicting Goal Kicks
The goal of this task is to predict whether a kick will result in a goal or not. By analyzing the spatio-temporal data of the match, we aim to develop models that can accurately predict the outcome of each kick.

You can follow the notebooks here to get more information of task 1.

## Task 2: Predicting Goal Position
In addition to predicting whether a kick will result in a goal, we also aim to predict the position of the goal. This task involves analyzing the spatio-temporal data to determine the most likely position where the ball will end up if it is kicked towards the goal.

For more information on task 2, you can refer to the notebooks provided.
